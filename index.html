            <h3>About Weston</h3>
            <p>I'm a born and raised Los Angeles, CA native, proudly embodying the essence of the West Coast. I grew up the middle child of two very loving parents, who I am very grateful for shaping me into the person I am today. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Iowa, pursuing a degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Sport and Recreation Management at the Tippie College of Business. I thrive on both the business and sports application of analytics in every facet, constantly seeking innovative ways to optimize performance and strategy.</p>
            <p>During my time at the University of Iowa, I have been privileged to serve as a Student Operations Management Intern for the Iowa Football Team, where I have played a pivotal role in supporting the seamless functioning of a high-profile Division I football program. In this capacity, I have honed my problem-solving skills, demonstrated excellent teamwork and communication abilities, and maintained a strong attention to detail—all while managing a full course load and attending to various other priorities and responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics and extracurriculars, you can often find me immersing myself in the vibrant culture and diverse experiences that Iowa City has to offer. Whether it's exploring local eateries, attending sporting events, or simply enjoying “the scenic beauty of the Midwest”. I've come to appreciate the unique charm of this community, even though it's a far cry from the bustling energy of Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>As I approach graduation, I am exploring opportunities to translate my academic knowledge and practical experience into a rewarding career post-graduation. Passionate, driven, and ready to embark on the next chapter of my journey in the world of business and sport.</p>
